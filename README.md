Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer refreshing my skill set after an 8-year hiatus. I'm currently enrolled in a Front End Software Development boot camp offered by Promineotech through Northwest Arkansas Community College and loving it! Upon completion of this 18-week course I will be actively seeking employment. The class wraps up in April 2023.
